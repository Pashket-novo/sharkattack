Shark Attacks

Data visualisation project, part of the university assignment. In this project, I prepared a visualisation of shark attacks across the world. It allows the discovery of the regions and water activities most associated with attacks. 
By interacting with data visualisation, one can find countries and regions where shark attacks happened, and see related details. 

Technology used:
R Shiny and hosted publicly on shinyapps.io  

Deeper data exploration was processed with Tableau, report with screenshots can be provided upon request.
